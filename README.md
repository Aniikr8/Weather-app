# Weather App
This weather app provides real-time weather data for various locations around the world. The data is fetched from a reliable weather API and is displayed based on the local time zone of each location.

<h2>üßê Features</h2>
  
  * Real-Time Data: The app fetches the latest weather data for the specified location.
  * Local Time Zone: Weather data is displayed according to the local time zone of the queried location.
Multiple Locations: Users can query weather information for different cities worldwide.
  



## Time Zone Handling

The weather data includes the local time of the queried location. This is done to ensure that the weather information is relevant to the user's current time. Each location's time zone is identified using the `tz_id` field from the weather API response.

```
"location": {         "name": "Delhi"         "region": "Ontario"         "country": "Canada"         "lat": 42.85         "lon": -80.5         "tz_id": "America/Toronto"         "localtime_epoch": 1719833493         "localtime": "2024-07-01 7:31"     }
```

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
